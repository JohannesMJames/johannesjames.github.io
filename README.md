Personal/academic website for [Johannes James](https://johannesjames.wtf/). 
This website is built on a fork of [Leonid Keselman's website](https://leonidk.com/), 
whose design is a modification of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/).
Dependencies: Imagemagik to convert images to smaller sized thumbnails using the shell scripts. See https://imagemagick.org/. A windows version of the shell scripts uses the default instatllation directory for the call to imagemagik.
