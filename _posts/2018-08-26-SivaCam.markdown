This work demonstrates a new, custom-built, low-weight (26 mg) camera mounted on a 74 mg flapping-wing robot. A convolution neural network (CNN) classified images measured by the custom camera in order to determine correct insect robot control actions such as whether to approach reward or instead escape predation.
