From a 10-minute iPhone scan of any environment, we condition procedural scene generation on that scan to generate training environments. Training a robot to perform ObjectNav in these scenes dramatically improves sim-to-real performance from 35% to 71% and results in an agent that is remarkably robust to human movement, lighting variations, added clutter, and rearranged objects.
