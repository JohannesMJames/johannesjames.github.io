This work shows some of Yogesh Chukewad's contributions to the robot control by demonstrating robot locomotion on the ground and on the water surface, significantly expanding the capabilities of the robot and leveraging its small size to vastly increase potential applications. In this work, power measurements were vital to characterize the cost of transport.
