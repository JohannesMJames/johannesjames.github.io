Previous flying insect robot designs have demonstrated controlled flight, but were limited in terms of locomotion capabilities outside of flight. They also consisted of many parts, making them difficult to fabricate. In this work we presented a re-design that lowers the center of mass, allowing the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs. Furthermore, we show that the new design allows for wing-driven ground locomotion.
