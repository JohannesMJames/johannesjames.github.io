This work demonstrates superlative technical skill by Vikram Iyer and Ali Najafi in interfacing our UW Robofly piezoelectric actuation and power electronics with a wireless camera system equipped with inertial measurement. The sensor "backpack" was suitable to be carried by a living beetle as well as a vibratory robot, and the camera can be steered by the piezoelectric actuator. Camera steering commands, IMU measurements, and images can be transmitted over wireless link to smartphone.
