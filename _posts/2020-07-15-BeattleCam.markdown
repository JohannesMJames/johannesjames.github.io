This work demonstrates superlative technical skill by Vikram Iyer and Ali Najafi in interfacing my UW Robofly piezoelectric actuator and power electronics with a wireless camera system equipped with inertial measurement. The sensor "backpack" was carried by a living beetle as well as a vibratory robot, and the camera was steered by the piezoelectric actuator. Camera steering commands, IMU measurements, and images can be transmitted over wireless link to smartphone.
