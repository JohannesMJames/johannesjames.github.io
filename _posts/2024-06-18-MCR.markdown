This work demonstrates wireless power transmission to a flying robot too light to carry batteries by using a technology similar to the wireless power famously used by Nikola Tesla: magnetically coupled resonators. I used a custom optimization routine, finite element EM analysis, and scripted CAD/CAM to create ultra light-weight resonant receiver coils which can be carried by the insect robot and power the wireless robot.
