This work demonstrates wireless power transmission to a flying robot too light to carry batteries by using a technology famously used by Nikola Tesla: magnetically coupled resonators. I used finite element analysis and bespoke optimization to routines and scripted CAD/CAM to create resonant receiver coils which can be carried by the robot and power the wireless robot.
